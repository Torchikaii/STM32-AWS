## FEATURE TO IMPLEMENT:

Currently I have added a blue LED turn on function. So When the MCU turns on blue LED turns on. I want you to make that LED to keep turning on/off with the interval of 1 second when MCU starts.

## DOCUMENTATION:

- J-Link firmware user guide: https://kb.segger.com/UM08001_J-Link_/_J-Trace_User_Guide

- J-Link on board: https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-ob/

- All datasheets are localted in `/Datasheets` folder

## Examples

Here's an example of STM32 project that uses STM32L073RZ development board for pressure regulation system (please note this project was created using MDK-ARM editor and not STMCubeIDE): https://github.com/Torchikaii/Pressure-regulation

Here's an example of STM32 project that uses STM32L073RZ develpment board for two ADC channel temperature reading (using termistors) and displaying output to LCD screen and also sending data to PC via UART (built using STM32CubeIDE): https://github.com/Torchikaii/STM32_Temperature
